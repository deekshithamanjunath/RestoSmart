	Our "RestoSmart" app is a smart application which can be used by restaurants to manage their day to day orders in a better manner. The application is mainly designed for the staff- separate credentials for the waiter and the manager. 
	The application flow is
	- Waiters register themselves for the application.
	- Once registered, they are allowed to take orders from customers. 
	- Assigning customer name is compulsory to allot the table. 
	- Once the table has been booked for the customer, waiter can proceed and start placing orders for the customer. 
	- There are options to delete the selected item or modify the selected item. 
	- Once customer confirms his order, the order is placed and a bill is generated. 
	- We have only just tried to imitate the process of placing the order and and check paid confirmation. 
	- Once the current customer has paid the check, waiter can go ahead and take orders from other customers. 
	- The manager log in, has options to add new dish, delete existing dish or update the price of an existing dish with options to select the categories as well.
	- There is no option for registering new managers. Manager role and permissions have been set.

Known Bugs:

When given the option to enter the customer name in the tableview activity, please enter only String. Number input isnt acceptable.
When adding a new dish as manager, dish name and dish description should be of type String. Numbers arent acceptable. Price paramter has no limits.
Sometimes when manager tries to modify the price of an item, when a ui element tries to access data before the data has been updated, app crashes but the price of the item wil be updated.
Manager log in is for only one device at a time.
